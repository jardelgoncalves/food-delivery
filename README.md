## Maybe you ask yourself: why Redux?
The objective of this project was to know and configure a simple project with redux toolkit (or RTK), as this project would combine very well with just Context API or React-Query.

## UI
For this project I created a Figma with all the pages, tokens and components, access it by [clicking here](https://www.figma.com/file/9LQOboZAKbBKwTYK9zbDtM/Food-Delivery%2B?node-id=7%3A136)
